Python object notation (_PyON_) is designed to literal representation of objects based on the syntax of the python language.

In Javascript _JSON_ is a native literal notation for objecs built-in into the language. You can just evaluate _JSON_ string to reconstruct object. 

The reason for the introduction of this notation lies in the following considerations:

  * Python now hasn't built-in into the language literal notation for objects representation.    

  * Python has great `pickle` module. It allows you to serialize/deserialize python objects that supports _pickle protocol_. But pickle's formats are not suitable for reading/writing human.    

  * Python has good `ast` module now. It is possible now to use the python language syntax for the literal representation of objects.

In _PyON_ we have attempted to join the pickle protocol 3 and current syntax of the python language for literal representation of python objects.
