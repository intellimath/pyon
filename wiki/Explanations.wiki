Python object notation (_PyON_) is designed to literal representation of objects based on the syntax of the python language.

In JavaScript _JSON_ is a native literal notation for objecs built-in into the language. You can just evaluate _JSON_-string to reconstruct object. 

Python has greate `pickle` module. It allows you to serialize/deserialize python objects that supports _pickle protocol_. Now all formats of object representation in `pickle` are not human readable.

Python now has greate `ast` module. It is now possible to use the python language syntax for the literal representation of objects.

In _PyON_ we have attempted to join the pickle protocol 3 and syntax of the python language.
