"""
`pyon` package implements dump/load facilities based on PyON
(http://code.google.com/p/pyon). 

Python object notation (PyON) is designed for literal representation of objects 
based on the syntax of the python language.

In PyON we have attempted to join the pickle protocol and current syntax of 
the python language for reconstructable literal representation of python objects.

There some features of PyON:
  * `pyon` dosn't use exec or eval during object reconstruction anyway;
  * `pyon` allows a programmer to manage the process of resolving names in PyON string;
  * `pyon` supports raw and "pretty" string dumping mode.

Here is a rough definition of the PyON::

    <pyon> ::= <expr>
    <pyon> ::= <assign>  ... <assign> <expr>
    <assign> ::= <name> = <expr> <newline> 
    <assign> ::= <name> [ <expr> ] = <expr> <newline> 
    <expr> ::= <int>
    <expr> ::= <bool>
    <expr> ::= <string>
    <expr> ::= <float>
    <expr> ::= <list>
    <expr> ::= <tuple>
    <expr> ::= <dict>
    <expr> ::= <instance>
    <expr> ::= <name>
    <expr> ::= <name>.<name> ... .<name>
    <list> ::= [ <expr>, ..., <expr> ] 
    <tuple> ::= ( <expr>, ..., <expr> ) 
    <dict> ::= { <expr> : <expr>, ..., <expr> : <expr> } 
    <instance> ::= <name> ( <args>, <kw>, <starargs>, <starkw> ) 
    <args> ::=  <expr>, ..., <expr> 
    <kw> := <name> = <expr>, ..., <name> = <expr> 
    <starargs> ::= *<list>
    <starargs> ::= *<tuple> 
    <starkw> ::= **<dict>
